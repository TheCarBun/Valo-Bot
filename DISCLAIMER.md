## 1. Riot Accounts. 
 
You hold yourself accountable if you are to use bots hosted using code from **Valo Bot** with your Riot Account, which may cause your account to be banned/suspended by Google. As per [**Valorant's Developer API Policy**](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/valorant):

### Valorant Game Policy
 
> **Examples of Unapproved Use Cases**
>
> The following use cases will not be approved:
>
>    - Scouting, which is seeing an opponents stats before a match starts.
>    - Apps that are not public and are designed for personal use only.
>    - Online store tracking or updates. The technology for this does not currently exist in the API.

Commands:

- The `/info` command shows the stats of any Valorant player when entered Correct Name and Tagline specifically violating this Use-Case as you're Scouting your opponent.

- The `/store` command shows the Featured store and not the Player's daily store but it still specifically violates this Use-Case, therefore exposing your account at risk for a ban or suspension. Until Riot decides to release official API endpoints for store checking, this method will remain "unapproved".
